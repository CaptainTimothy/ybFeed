### Introduction

In a nutshell, ybFeed is a personnal micro feed where you can post snippets of 
text or images.

The primary use case is to share information between computers where you don't
have the possibility to copy/paste, like a restricted VDI environment.

Open the feed on your local computer and the remote one, then everything you add
will be displayed on the other browser as well.
